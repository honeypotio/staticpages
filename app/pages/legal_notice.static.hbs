        <strong>Does Honeypot use Cookies?</strong>
        <br>A Cookie is a small file sent by Honeypot – like many other internet services do – to the user’s browser which is then stored on the user’s device in order to recognize the user when the user revisits our Service the next time. Such Cookie usually contains the name of the domain the Cookie originates from, the durability of the Cookie until it expires, and a value in terms of a unique number generated by a respective random generator.</br>
        <br>Using such Cookies enables Honeypot to recognize the user, and to statistically record the use of the service as well as analyze it in order to improve it. This can make the use of Honeypot’s service easier for the user. The website can be accessed with cookies disabled, but the Service may not be usable or its usability deteriorated without cookies. Cookies that are already on the device may be deleted by the user at any time, manually or doing so via the settings of the browser. We want to point out, however, that using the Service provided by Honeypot may possibly be limited or not as convenient without Cookies.</br>
      </p>
      <p class='text-left'>
        <strong>Does Honeypot use analytics tools?</strong>
        <br>Honeypot automatically records information, namely usage data. For advertising, market research, improvement of existing and creation of new innovative products, Honeypot may create aggregated anonymized data.</br>
        <br>Besides that, Honeypot uses Google Analytics to track the usage of the Service in order to optimize the Service for the users. All data is used in anonymized form.</br>
        <br>Google Analytics is a web analytics service of Google Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses so-called Cookies, text files, which are stored on the user’s device and which enable an analysis of the use of the Service by the user. By activating IP anonymization on the Service, the IP address of the user will however be shortened by Google within the member states of the European Union or other contracting states of the agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transferred to a server in the US and shortened there. Google will, on behalf of Honeypot, use the information to analyze the use of the Service by the user, in order to compile reports about the activities of users on the Service and in order to provide further services associated with the use of the Service and the internet. Google will in no way combine the IP address of a user with other data of Google. users can prevent the installation of the cookies by a corresponding setting of the browser software; Honeypot however points out that in this case users can if applicable not use all functions of the Service of Honeypot in full. The users can object to the collection and use of their IP address by Google Analytics by downloading and installing the browser plugin available here:</br>
        <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en">Opt-out (browser plugin)</a>
        <br>As an alternative to using the browser plugin or in the browser on mobile devices, you may click the following link to prevent the collection by Google Analytics in the future:</br>
        <a href="javascript:gaOptout()">Opt-out (cookie)</a>
        <br>Thereby, a cookie will be placed on your device. In case you delete your cookies, you will have to click the link again.</br>
      </p>
      <p class='text-left'>
        <strong>Does Honeypot save my data in case of me making a request?</strong>

      </p>
      <p class='text-left'>
        <strong>Is my data secure?</strong>
