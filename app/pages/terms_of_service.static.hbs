              provided by third parties upon the instruction of Honeypot. Third
              party services are not provided by Honeypot. Honeypot or the third

              of these Terms of Service (

              ).
            </li>
            <li>

              to prove the identity such as a personal ID card. Honeypot is entitled
              to make the creation of an account subject to such verification.
            </li>

              In addition, Honeypot is entitled to delete the contents of the Talent.
              The same applies to definite indications of a violation against these
              Terms of Service to contents, which are otherwise illegal. There is no
              entitlement to the recovery of deleted content. Such claim is also

            </li>
            <li>
              Without the prior express written consent of Honeypot, any blocked
              Talent is prohibited from creating a new account. If this ban was

            </li>
            <li>
              The provisions of this Section 4 do not limit the termination right

          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          Functioning of the Service / Honeypot&rsquo;s responsibilities
          <ol>
            <li>
              Honeypot provides the Service to connect Talent and Companies.
              The Service works as follows:
              <br>
              Talent sign-up to the Service and make their curriculum vitae and other
              information as specified in the Terms of Service or the Talent Terms
              of Service available. Companies also sign-up and provide a profile.
              This profile is only visible to Talents that the Companies are
              interested in as defined below. Companies can browse the Talent
              profiles in a list and detailed view and decide to apply to the
              respective Talent by sending an interview requests. These interview
              requests come with a first, non-binding offer proposal of what
              compensation package the company has in mind. Talent can review the
              interview requests and are now able to browse the profiles of Companies
              that have sent the requests. The Talent can accept or reject the
              interview request. If rejected, the Company may (upon choice of the
              Talent) re-contact the Talent with a revised proposal. If accepted,
              Honeypot connects Talent and Company.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once a Talent has been viewed by a Company in the list view it is
              considered to be introduced by Honeypot (
              <strong>"Introduction"</strong>
              ). If Talent and Company had been introduced in the past nine months
              before the Introduction by a third party and Company does not inform
              Honeypot about this within five business days in writing and substantive
              materials showing the introduction, the Talent is considered to have
              been introduced by Honeypot. Email or the Service are sufficient media
              in this matter. A Talent is considered to be already introduced by
              a third party when there is a written communication concerning the
              Talent, with a clear identification of the Talent and the Company and
              with a clear identification of the opportunity to hire the Talent.
            </li>
            <li>An Introduction on the Service lasts nine months.</li>
            <li>
              Honeypot may from time to time, but is under no obligation to, suggest a
              specific Talent to a Company or vice versa. The Talent is then also seen
              as introduced. This can be done via e-mail, messaging service or phone.
            </li>
            <li>
              Honeypot undertakes reasonable efforts to match Talent and Companies,
              however, Honeypot does under no circumstances represent, assume a
              warranty or guarantee or undertake in any other way that Talent or
              Company will find a match through Honeypot and/or the Service.
            </li>
            <br>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          Obligations of Talent
          <ol>
            <li>
              Talent shall submit the information about him/or herself as requested
              in the compulsory and voluntary fields of the sign-up form.
            </li>
            <li>
              Honeypot may add compulsory or voluntary fields from time to time. The
              Talent shall not transmit any personal data of third (i.e. data
              allowing identification of an individual) to Honeypot, unless data
              protection laws allow for such transmission or Talent has obtained
              consent from the concerned parties. Honeypot may also request
              additional information from Talent on a case by case basis.
            </li>
            <li>
              Unless otherwise provided in these Terms of Service, Honeypot will
              usually communicate with the Talent via e-mail. The Talent shall make
              sure that it receives all e-mails sent by Honeypot to the address
              submitted in the course of the application, or at a later date. The
              Talent will in particular configure the spam filter accordingly and
              regularly check all incoming e-mail under this address. Honeypot may
              choose any other appropriate means of communication.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Talent shall keep all access data (login, passwords etc.) for the

              case it learns or suspects that an unauthorized third person is in
              possession of the Access Data.
            </li>
            <li>
              In case Honeypot has reason to believe that an unauthorized third party
              is in possession of Access Data, Honeypot may, without assuming any
              responsibility to do so, and always acting in its sole discretion,
              change the Access Data without prior notice or block the respective
              account. Honeypot will promptly inform the Talent and will, upon request,
              communicate the new Access Data to the Talent without undue delay. The
              Talent cannot claim to have its initial Access Data restored.
            </li>
            <li>
              In case a third party uses of Access Data, with the Talent at fault,
              the Talent&rsquo;s Access Data, the Talent is liable for all such actions,
              and for damages. In such event, all access through the Talent&rsquo;s Access
              Data shall be considered as an access by the Talent.
            </li>
            <li>
              Honeypot is not responsible for providing or assisting with the
              obtaining of any work or other permits and/or medicals and other country
              specific regulations and requirements that may be necessary to employ
              Talent.

          Placement / Payment
          <ol>
            <li>
              Talent undertakes to inform Honeypot in writing (through the service or
              via email is sufficient) as soon as possible, but no later than fourteen
              business days, if he was hired or otherwise contracted by Company (
              <strong>"Placement"</strong>
              ). Honeypot may contact Talent to request status updates about ongoing
              negotiations.
            </li>
            <li>
              Placement shall mean any form of employment, temporary employment,
              contracting or other use of Talent by Company or an undertaking
              affiliated with Company in the sense of Sec. 15ff. of the German

                Honeypot&rsquo;s failure to act with respect to a breach by the Talent does not waive

              Honeypot can utilize the services of independent third parties for the Service

              <strong>"Third Party Service"</strong>
              ) such as app stores and social networks. No third party
              services are provided by third parties upon the instruction of Honeypot. Third
              party services are not provided by Honeypot. Honeypot or the third party will
              identify these services in a suitable manner. Any issues in connection with third
              party services are not affected by these Terms of Service. Honeypot shall not be
              responsible for third party services. Third party services are potentially subject

            </li>
            <li>
              Honeypot is entitled to stop such violations against this Section 2. In addition,
              Honeypot is entitled to delete the contents of the Company. The same applies to
              definite indications of a violation against these Terms of Service to contents,
              which are otherwise illegal. There is no entitlement to the recovery of deleted
              content. Such claim is also voided if the restoration is not possible for technical
              reasons.
            </li>
            <li>
              The provisions of this Section 2 do not limit the termination right of Honeypot &mdash;
              particularly the right to terminate effective immediately &mdash; in accordance with

          Functioning of the Service / Honeypot&rsquo;s responsibilities
          <ol>
            <li>
              Honeypot provides the Service to connect Talent and Companies. The Service
              works as follows:
              Talent sign-up to the Service and make a profile available. Companies provide a
              profile after concluding the Recruiting Partnership Agreement. This profile is only
              visible to Talents that the Companies are interested in as defined below.
              Companies can browse the Talent profiles in a list and detailed view and decide
              to apply to the respective Talent by sending an interview request through the
              detailed view. These interview requests come with a first, non-binding offer
              proposal of what compensation package the company has in mind. Talent can
              review the interview requests and are now able to browse the profiles of
              Companies that have sent the requests. The Talent can accept or reject the
              interview request. If rejected, the Company may (upon choice of the Talent) recontact
              the Talent with a revised proposal. If accepted, Honeypot connects Talent
              and Company.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once a Talent has been viewed by a Company in the detailed view it is
              considered to be introduced by Honeypot (
              <strong>&ldquo;Introduction&rdquo;</strong>
              ). If Talent and
              Company had been introduced in the past twelve months before the Introduction
              by a third party and Company does not inform Honeypot about this within five
              business days in writing and substantive materials showing the introduction, the
              Talent is considered to have been introduced by Honeypot. Email or the Service
              are sufficient media in this matter. A Talent is considered to be already
              introduced by a third party when there is a written communication concerning
              the Talent, with a clear identification of the Talent and the Company and with a
              clear identification of the opportunity to hire the Talent.
            </li>
            <li>
              Honeypot may from time to time, but is under no obligation to, suggest a
              specific Talent to a Company or vice versa. The Talent is then also seen as
              introduced. This can be done via e-mail, messaging service or phone.
            </li>
            <li>
              Honeypot undertakes reasonable efforts to match Talent and Companies,
              however, Honeypot does under no circumstances represent, assume a warranty
              or guarantee or undertake in any other way that Talent or Company will find a
              match through Honeypot and/or the Service.
            </li>

        <li>
          Obligations of Company
          <ol>
            <li>
              Company shall submit the information about the Company as requested in the
              compulsory and voluntary fields of the sign-up form or as requested via email
              by Honeypot.
            </li>
            <li>
              Honeypot may add compulsory or voluntary fields from time to time. Honeypot
              may also request additional information from Company on a case by case basis.
              The Company shall not transmit any personal data (i.e. data allowing
              identification of an individual) to Honeypot, unless data protection laws allow
              for such transmission or Company has obtained consent from the concerned
              parties.
            </li>
            <li>
              Unless otherwise provided in these Terms of Service, Honeypot will usually
              communicate with the Company via e-mail. The Company shall make sure that
              it receives all e-mails sent by Honeypot to the address submitted in the course of
              the application, or at a later date. The Company will in particular configure the
              spam filter accordingly and regularly check all incoming e-mail under this
              address. Honeypot may choose any other appropriate means of communication.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Company shall keep all access data (login, passwords etc.) for the Service
              (
              <strong>&ldquo;Access Data&rdquo;</strong>
              ) strictly confidential. The Company shall promptly inform Honeypot in case it learns or suspects that an unauthorized third person is in
              possession of the Access Data.
            </li>
            <li>
              In case Honeypot has reason to believe that an unauthorized third party is in
              possession of Access Data, Honeypot may, without assuming any responsibility
              to do so, and always acting in its sole discretion, change the Access Data without
              prior notice or block the respective account. Honeypot will promptly inform the
              Company and will, upon request, communicate the new Access Data to the
              Company without undue delay. The Company cannot claim to have its initial
              Access Data restored.
            </li>
            <li>
              In case a third party uses Access Data, with the Company at fault, the
              Company&rsquo;s Access Data, the Company is liable for all such actions, and for
              damages. In such event, all access through the Company&rsquo;s Access Data shall be
              considered as an access by the Company.
            </li>
            <li>
              During the term of the Agreement, the Company will not induce, or assist in the
              inducement of, any employee of Honeypot or any of its affiliates to leave their
              employment with Honeypot or any of its affiliates. This shall apply to the extent
              permissible under Sec. 75 of the German Commercial Code.
            </li>
            <li>
              Honeypot is not responsible for providing or assisting with the obtaining of any
              work or other permits and/or medicals hat may be and other country specific
              regulations and requirements that may be necessary to employ Talent.
            </li>
            <li>
              Honeypot is relying on the information provided by the Talent. Company has the
              obligation to satisfy itself, that the Talent is suitable for the indented job
              and fits Company's requirements.

          Placement / Payment
          <ol>
            <li>
              Company undertakes to inform Honeypot in writing (through the service or via
              email is sufficient) as soon as possible, but no later than the number of days
              specified in the Recruiting Partnership Agreement if an introduced Talent is hired
              or otherwise contracted by Company (
              <strong>&ldquo;Placement&rdquo;</strong>
              ). The notification
              must include the start date and information about the Salary as defined in Section 5.3
              below. Honeypot may contact Company to request status updates about ongoing
              negotiations.
            </li>
            <li>
              Placement shall mean any form of employment, temporary employment,
              contracting or other use of Talent by Company or an undertaking affiliated with
              Company in the sense of Sec. 15ff. of the German Stock Company Act.
            </li>
            <li>
              If Talent is placed pursuant to Section 5.2 during the period of an Introduction,
              Honeypot will receive a commission as specified in the Recruiting Partnership
              Agreement, of the Talents salary (
              <strong>&ldquo;Salary&rdquo;</strong>
              ). Salary shall include the gross base
              salary or fees, bonus (guaranteed and/or anticipated), commissions, allowances,
              inducement payments, shift allowances, location weighting and call-out allowances, and all other compensation the Talent receives or is anticipated to
              receive during the first year of his placement. Excluded is compensation paid by
              Company to Talent to compensate expenditures (e.g. travel, relocation, visa
              application) as well as any equity, share options or similar compensation options.
              To clarify: bonuses based on company performance are not excluded. Company
              undertakes to inform Honeypot about the Salary upon notifying Honeypot about
              the placement.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the Placement is for less than twelve months, Honeypot&rsquo;s commission will be
